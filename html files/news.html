          <h1>US inflation outstrips forecasts with rise to 3.4% for December</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/1st news article.avif" alt = "1st news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Claire Jones & Kate Duguid<br>12 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>US inflation outstripped forecasts in December, hitting 3.4 per cent on an annual basis and dimming market expectations that 
            interest rates would fall as soon as March.
            <br><br>Economists had expected a rise of 3.2 per cent, up from 3.1 per cent in November.
            <br><br>The core rate also came in higher than economists had hoped, in an apparent vindication of the US Federal Reserve's caution over cutting rates from their 23-year-high.
            <br><br>US stocks fell following the data showing a headline 3.4 per cent annual rise in consumer prices. The blue-chip S&P 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite both declined 0.4 per cent in New York.
            <br><br>In the futures market, traders slightly reduced expectations that the Fed would cut rates in March. 
            <br><br>Rate setters have said that they want to be confident that inflation was moving towards their 2 per cent goal before dialling back on high interest rates.
            <br><br>The CPI number is not rate-setters' preferred measure of inflation, with most on the Fed's monetary policy committee focusing on the personal consumption expenditures index.
            <br><br>The PCE figure for December comes out on January 26, just five days before the Fed's next policy vote, and could show a lower inflation reading as it places far less weight on changes in the cost of shelter. Those costs rose 0.5 per cent month-on-month, according to Thursday's CPI report.
            <br><br>Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, was 3.9 per cent for the year to December, slightly lower than the 4 per cent figure for November, according to the data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But economists had expected 3.8 per cent.
            <br><br>Despite the uptick in December, price pressures fell much more sharply than expected in 2023, prompting the White House to note that inflation was now down about two-thirds from the peak seen during the summer of 2022.

          <p>Venezuela's 2023 inflation hit nearly 190%, but December prices barely ticked up
            <br><br>Venezuela's annual inflation rate settled at 189.8% last year, according to data from the central bank released on Friday, marking a slight easing of the still sky-high rate of rising consumer prices in the South American nation's battered economy.
            <br><br>The inflation rate during the previous year clocked in at 234%, one of the highest inflation rates anywhere in the world.
            <br><br>But Venezuela's monthly inflation for December eased to just 2.4%, according to the bank.
            <br><br>While Venezuela's economy has suffered a prolonged meltdown marked by triple-digit inflation and a mass exodus of millions of migrants seeking better prospects elsewhere, its inflation rate is no longer Latin America's steepest since Argentina's sped past 200% last year.

          <h1>Deflation: Here's where prices fell in December 2023, in one chart</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/3rd news article.webp" alt = "3rd news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Greg Iacurci<br>12 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>Deflation: Here's where prices fell in December 2023, in one chart
            <br><br>As inflation continues to throttle back across the broad U.S. economy, some consumer categories have sunk into outright deflation.
            In other words: Americans are seeing prices decline for certain items.
            Those pullbacks have largely been among physical goods rather than services, economists said.
            <br><br>Demand for goods soared early in the Covid-19 pandemic, as consumers were confined to their homes. The health crisis also snarled global supply chains for those goods. These dynamics drove up prices. Now, they're falling back to earth.
            <br><br>“You have seen some [price] give-back in some categories that were most affected by the shift in consumer demand, as well as being affected most severely by some of the supply-chain issues we saw over the course of the pandemic,” according to Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics.
            <br><br>For example, average prices have declined in these categories, among others, since December 2022: toys (by 4.5%), college textbooks (4.9%), televisions (10.3%), men's suits, sport coats, and outerwear (6%), sporting goods (2.5%), furniture and bedding (4.3%), and computer software and accessories (9.9%), according to the consumer price index.
            <br><br>“We bought a lot of goods because we couldn't go out, travel, go to ballgames” early in the pandemic, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. “There has been a shift from goods to things we couldn't do when we were shut in.”
            <br><br>Prices for used cars and trucks have also fallen, by 1.3%, according to CPI data.
            Used and new vehicle prices were among the first to surge when the U.S. economy reopened broadly early in 2021, amid a shortage of semiconductor chips essential for manufacturing.
            However, price levels on used cars remain more than 30% higher than they were pre-pandemic, meaning there's likely still ample room for a reversal, said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
            <br><br>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't assess health insurance inflation based on consumer premiums. It does so indirectly by measuring insurers' profits. This is because insurance quality varies greatly from person to person. One person's premiums may buy high-value insurance benefits, while another's buys meager coverage.
            <br><br>Those differences in quality make it difficult to gauge changes in health insurance prices with accuracy.
            <br><br>The 27.1% decline in health insurance prices last year reflects smaller insurer profits in 2021 relative to 2020.
            These sorts of quality adjustments mean consumers don't necessarily see prices drop at the store — only on paper.

          <h1>BOJ seen sticking to forecast of inflation staying near target, sources say</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/4th news article.avif" alt = "4th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Reuters<br>12 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>TOKYO : The Bank of Japan is expected this month to broadly maintain its projection that trend inflation will stay near its 2 per cent target in coming years, despite global economic uncertainties and soft consumption, say sources familiar with its thinking.
            <br><br>The projection will be part of the bank's quarterly outlook report due at its next rate review on Jan. 22-23, when the board is widely expected to keep ultra-loose policy settings unchanged.
            <br><br>Any such forecast will likely underscore the BOJ's cautious optimism that the economy was making steady progress towards sustainably achieving its 2 per cent inflation target - a prerequisite for pulling short-term interest rates out of negative territory.
            <br><br>The BOJ has maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1 per cent and the 10-year bond yield target around 0 per cent since 2016.
            <br><br>"Consumption is holding up and there's growing conviction that wage hikes will continue, and even broaden, this year," one source said.
            <br><br>"The broad uptrend in inflation and wages remains intact," said another source, a view echoed by three other people.
            <br><br>In the quarterly outlook report, the nine-member board releases a median projection on economic growth, core consumer inflation that strips away the effect of volatile fresh food prices, and "core core" inflation, which also excludes fuel costs.
            <br><br>The board is likely to cut its core inflation forecast for fiscal 2024, which begins in April, from the current projection of 2.8 per cent, due to recent falls in crude oil prices, the sources say.
            <br><br>But it is likely to make no major changes to its forecast that "core core" inflation, which the BOJ sees as a better gauge of the broader price trend, will hit 1.9 per cent in both fiscal 2024 and 2025, the sources say.
            <br><br>With inflation having exceeded the BOJ's 2 per cent target for well over a year, many market players expect the central bank to exit negative interest rates sometime this year in what would be a landmark move away from decades of ultra-loose monetary policy.
            <br><br>The BOJ's January quarterly report and Ueda's post-meeting briefing may offer clues on whether the central bank could phase out stimulus either at its March or April meetings.
            <br><br>Among key events that may sway the timing is the conclusion of annual wage negotiations between big firms and their unions in mid-March. The outcome becomes a benchmark for wage talks among smaller firms and sets the trend for nationwide pay.

          <h1>India's retail inflation rises to four-month high in December on higher food prices</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/5th news article.avif" alt = "5th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Reuters<br>12 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>INDIA'S annual retail inflation rose at the fastest pace in four months in December, driven by a rise in prices of some food items, raising expectations that the central bank will stay away from interest rate cuts for some time.
            <br><br>Annual retail inflation rose to 5.69 per cent in December from 5.55 per cent the previous month, above the central bank's 4 per cent target, Indian government data showed on Friday (Jan 12).
            <br><br>Food inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, was at 9.53 per cent in December, up from 8.70 per cent in November as prices of vegetables, pulses and spices rose.
            <br><br>“The outlook for the inflation for certain items like rice, wheat and pulses remains somewhat vulnerable,” said Aditi Nayar, an economist at ICRA, who does not expect rate cuts before August 2024.
            <br><br>The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent for a fifth consecutive meeting last month. With inflation remaining above the central bank's target, monetary policy could remain in “restrictive territory”, the RBI said in a report last month.
            <br><br>Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was estimated to be 3.8 per cent to 3.89 per cent in December, compared with 4.05 per cent to 4.2 per cent in November, according to two economists.
            <br><br>Core inflation has declined to a four-year low, said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research.
            <br><br>Declining core inflation, which can often reflect weak demand in the economy, is a “conundrum” at a time of strong economic growth, said Pant.
            <br><br>The Indian economy is seen growing at 7.3 per cent in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, according to the government's estimates.
            <br><br>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who remains popular among voters and is aiming to win a third term in a general election due by May, has taken several steps to contain food prices.

          <h1>From housing to energy to food, US inflation picks up, though some costs rise only mildly</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/6th news article.png" alt = "6th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Paul Wiseman, Anne D'Innocenzio & Laura Bargfeld<br>12 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Higher energy and housing prices boosted overall U.S. inflation in December, a sign that the Federal Reserve's drive to slow inflation to its 2% target will likely remain a bumpy one.
            <br><br>Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that overall prices rose 0.3% from November and 3.4% from 12 months earlier. Those gains exceeded the previous 0.1% monthly rise and the 3.1% annual inflation in November and were slightly above economists' forecasts.
            <br><br>More than half the increase in prices from November to December reflected higher housing costs. Energy costs, along with food prices, also contributed to inflation.
            <br><br>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, though, so-called core prices rose just 0.3% month over month, unchanged from November's increase. Core prices were up 3.9% from a year earlier — the mildest such pace since May 2021. Economists pay particular attention to core prices because, by excluding costs that typically jump around from month to month, they're seen as a better guide to the likely path of inflation.
            <br><br>Inflation has cooled more or less steadily since hitting 9.1% in mid-2022. Still, despite the slowdown in price increases, along with steady economic growth, low unemployment and healthy hiring, polls show many Americans are dissatisfied with the economy
            <br><br>That disconnect, a likely issue in the 2024 elections, has puzzled economists and political analysts. A major factor is the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Much of the public remains exasperated by higher prices. Prices are still 17% higher than they were before the inflation surge began and are still rising.
            <br><br>Pollsters and economists say there's never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception. Wage gains have outpaced inflation in recent months, meaning that Americans' average after-inflation take-home pay is up. Yet a poll conducted in November by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about three-quarters of respondents described the economy as poor. Two-thirds said their expenses had risen.
            <br><br>“Our grocery bill has doubled,” said Megan Cherry, a psychologist who lives with her husband and children in Temple Terrace, Florida. “We've got to change how much we get of each thing. Our kids noticed recently that, 'Wow, we eat a lot of chicken.' Well, because we can afford chicken.”
            <br><br>Thursday's figures reflected the outsize role that housing plays in the U.S. consumer price index — roughly a third of the index. A measure of homeownership alone makes up about 25% of CPI. The government measures homeownership costs by calculating how much rent a homeowner would likely charge if that home were being rented, a figure seen as equivalent to the cost of owning the property. Overall housing prices rose 0.5% from November to December. Rents were up 0.4%, homeownership 0.5%.
            <br><br>Over the past year, consumers have enjoyed price declines for some individual items. Furniture and bedding prices are down 4%, for example. Men's suits and coats are 6% lower, televisions 10%, sporting goods nearly 3%, sausages nearly 4%.
            <br><br>The Fed, which began aggressively raising interest rates in March 2022 to try to slow the pace of price increases, wants to reduce year-over-year inflation to its 2% target level. And there are solid reasons for optimism that inflationary pressure will continue to recede in the coming months.

          <p>Consumer prices in the US rose again in December, driven by higher costs for housing, dining out and car insurance.
            <br><br>Inflation was up from 3.1% in November, accelerating more over the month than many analysts had expected.
            <br><br>The figure is likely to keep the US central bank cautious about declaring victory in its fight against inflation.
            <br><br>The US Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2% and, until last summer, had been raising interest rates to cool price rises.
            <br><br>Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the latest inflation figures are "not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down".
            <br><br>Inflation in the world's largest economy has dropped sharply since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, when the war in Ukraine sent energy costs soaring.
            <br><br>Despite the uptick in December, many analysts said they expected inflation to improve in the coming months.
            <br><br>"This is another [Consumer Price Index] report that shows inflation has moderated and will likely continue to decelerate," said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.
            <br><br>But while price increases for goods have cooled, as supply bottlenecks from the pandemic clear, the report suggests that progress in other areas is proving more difficult, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.
            <br><br>Prices for car insurance were up 20% compared with December 2022 while rents climbed 6.5%, according to the US Labor Department.
            <br><br>It said that grocery prices gained a modest 1.3%, which compares to a 5.2% rise in prices for people choosing to dine out.The cost of some food to eat at home soared, with steak up 11% over the year.

          <p>The Bank of England may be forced to bring forward the date of its first interest rate cut after three leading forecasters issued a surprise update suggesting the inflation rate will halve to 2% by April.
            <br><br>The Oxford Economics consultancy and analysts at Investec and Deutsche Bank have reassessed their outlook for inflation in 2024 and concluded that the consumer prices index (CPI), which dropped to 3.9% in November last year, will fall below 2% within four months.
            <br><br>A slump in energy prices and the cost of oil on international wholesale markets will, they say, bring down inflation at a faster rate than the Bank of England expected when it reviewed price rises in November.
            <br><br>The independent forecasters said a fresh review next month by officials at the Bank's headquarters on Threadneedle Street was likely to follow their lead and predict a much lower path for inflation this year.
            <br><br>In a series of speeches before Christmas, members of the BoE's interest rate setting committee said lending rates would remain high during 2024 to reduce the prospect of a return to galloping price rises.
            <br><br>The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, had predicted a tough battle lay ahead to bring inflation back to its 2% target, pushing back against speculation in the financial markets that official borrowing costs would soon be reduced from their current level of 5.25%.
            <br><br>Since then financial markets have brought forward betting on the first likely interest rate cut to April and raised the likelihood of another five cuts before the end of the year, bringing interest rates below 4% for the first time since January 2023.
            <br><br>At a hearing of the Treasury committee on Wednesday, Bailey said he hoped the recent fall in the cost of mortgages would continue.
            <br><br>“Obviously we have had a big change in market interest rates in the last few months and so the cost of mortgages is coming down,” he said.
            <br><br>Bailey refused to comment on the outlook for monetary policy, but said: “Let's just take the market for a moment - obviously that is feeding through into mortgage costs and I hope that is something that continues.”
            <br><br>The rates for mortgages fixed over five years have tumbled in response to growing optimism about the fall in inflation.
            <br><br>Investors have tended to disregard warnings about higher costs pushing inflation higher, including concerns about the Suez canal and a spike in shipping costs resulting from the war in the Middle East.
            <br><br>Energy and fuel prices have declined on international wholesale markets, pushing down the cost of heating and transport. The cost of food, which is influenced by transport costs, is also expected to fall steeply this year.

          <h1>Australia's soaring costs aren't about groceries. It's about wealth inequity.</h1>

          <h10>Written by: John Quiggin<br>8 January 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>The policy debate about the cost of living is among the most confused and confusing in recent memory. All sorts of measures to reduce the cost of living are proposed, then criticised as being potentially inflationary. The argument implies, absurdly, that reducing the cost of living will increase the cost of living.
            <br><br>The issue here is that the “cost of living” is an essentially meaningless concept, rather like the sound of one hand clapping. The problem isn't the cost of buying goods, but whether our income is sufficient to pay for those goods. For most of us, that means the real (inflation-adjusted) value of our wages, after paying tax and (for homebuyers) mortgage interest.
            <br><br>In the famous Harvester decision of 1907, Justice Henry Bournes Higgins of the Arbitration Court determined that a family of five could live in “frugal comfort” on 42 shillings ($4.20) a week, less than the price of a cup of coffee today. On this basis, he set the basic wage at 42 shillings a week, or about nine cents an hour for the then-standard 48-hour working week.
            <br><br>Looking back over the past century or so, the cost of buying a basic bundle of necessities (and some modest luxuries) has risen almost continuously. But, fortunately, wages and other incomes have risen much faster. So while people complain about the cost of living today, few of us would want to go back to the frugal comfort of 1907.
            <br><br>Looking at more recent history, the consumer price index rose faster for much of the 1980s than it has done over the last few years. Inflation was a significant problem for macroeconomic management and financial markets. But the “cost of living” was not a big issue because wages were indexed under the Prices and Incomes Accord. Some small reductions in real wages were compensated for by the reintroduction of Medicare and improvements in superannuation.
            <br><br>The Accord, focused on real wages, produced a gradual decline in inflation rates, while maintaining standards of living. By contrast, the current discussion of policy in terms of the cost of living has produced incoherent policies and declining living standards.
            <br><br>The natural policy response to concerns about the cost of living is to seek reductions in prices that are politically sensitive (such as petrol, electricity and basic groceries) and to provide ad hoc relief to groups seen as “doing it tough”. This has included wage increased to offset inflation for particularly “deserving” groups (minimum wage earners and aged care workers), even as the real value of most wages remains far below pre-pandemic levels. Labor estimates the value of their 2022-23 cost-of-living relief package at $14.6bn.
            <br><br>In the neoliberal context, any benefits given to one group of wage earners or welfare beneficiaries must be offset by costs imposed on another. The ad hoc nature of policy responses to the perceived cost-of-living crisis reflects the incomplete and inadequate nature of this framing of the issue. But it is not the worst consequence.
            <br><br>The crucial problem with “cost of living” thinking is the implication that the problem will be resolved by reducing the inflation rate, ideally with a rapid return to the Reserve Bank target range of 2-3%. In this way of thinking, the worst thing that could happen is for wages to rise enough to offset past inflation. Such an adjustment, it is claimed, could set off an inflationary spiral.
            <br><br>In the end, the “cost of living” isn't about the prices on grocery shelves, it's about the distribution of income. In Australia, income has shifted from wages to profits and from low- and middle-income earners to those in the top 10% of the income scale and, even more, to the handful of “rich listers” whose growing wealth has outstripped that of ordinary Australians many times over.

          <h1>'Everyone cites Covid and Brexit': UK businesses going bust rises 52% in two years</h1>

          <p><b>Interest rate rises, inflation, and skills and labour shortages all contributed to sharp increase in company insolvencies in 2023.</b>
            <br><br>Company insolvencies soared last year as businesses struggled with the inflation crisis and the long-term impact of the Covid pandemic, new figures show.
            <br><br>A total of 30,199 UK businesses were involved in some kind of insolvency action in 2023 - 52% higher than in 2021, according to Creditsafe, a credit checking agency which tracks 430m businesses around the world.
            <br><br>Some of those insolvencies are likely to have been companies which would have failed earlier but were kept afloat by government help during the pandemic, according to Drew Fahiya, Creditsafe's data director.
            <br><br>“For the companies that were doing well, Covid really hurt them, but for the ones that were struggling anyway, it probably gave them a bit of breathing space to get them back where they needed to be,” he said.
            <br><br>Others are businesses which where thriving until Covid. The Prop Factory had been turning over £800,000 a year and employing 15 people to make and hire out vintage games such as coconut shies and duck-shoot galleries for corporate events.
            <br><br>“We did Facebook's Christmas party in Dublin, we've worked for Google, we did Renault Formula One's Christmas party,” said Carmen Croxall, the co-founder.
            <br><br>That ground to a halt when the pandemic hit, and in spite of a boost in 2022, when there was a mini-boom due to pent-up demand from customers keen to hold a celebration, they closed the event-hire business just before Christmas.
            <br><br>“It never really recovered,” she said. “This year was 46% down - there was a seismic shift in the industry because people have made cutbacks, and we were right at the bottom of the pecking order.”
            <br><br>Now they are selling most of their remaining props, but hope is on the horizon - they ran a Christmas SelfieLand event last year where 6,000 people paid for the chance to take selfies in front of 20 different backdrops.

          <h1>Danone to cut 7% off wholesale price of powdered Aptamil baby formula</h1>

          <p><b>An investigation by the UK's competition watchdog found the company had raised prices by 25% in two years</b>
            <br><br>The baby milk seller Danone has agreed to cut the wholesale price of its Aptamil infant powdered formula by 7% from Monday after the UK's competition watchdog launched an investigation into high inflation in the market.
            <br><br>The French company, which also owns the Cow & Gate brand, accounts for 71% of the baby formula market in the UK, where manufacturers have been found by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to have raised prices by 25% in two years.
            <br><br>The price of an 800g pack of Danone's Aptamil formula went up 26% to about £14.50 between March 2021 and April 2023. The same size pack of Cow & Gate 1 rose 31% according to data compiled by the public health nutrition charity First Steps Nutrition Trust (FSNT).
            <br><br>Danone's 7% price cut applies to all its powdered Aptamil formulas sold to UK retailers but not liquid baby milks or any of its Cow & Gate products.
            <br><br>Its decision to partly reverse its price rises is likely to put pressure on other major manufacturers to follow suit, including Nestlé, which owns the SMA and Little Steps brands and accounts for about 14% of the UK market.
            <br><br>The CMA launched an investigation late last year saying it was concerned that baby formula was vulnerable to higher-than-inflation price rises as parents were nervous of switching brands and only one supermarket own-label alternative existed - from the cut-price chain Aldi.
            <br><br>The watchdog found those who do switch brands could save as much as £500 a year by doing so. It added that annual costs could also be being pushed up by manufacturers' feeding volume guides, which were “systematically higher” than those recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.
            <br><br>The supermarket Iceland said it would be cutting the price of three 800g Aptamil powders it sold from £12 to £11.20. Richard Walker, the executive chairman of the retailer's parent group, hit out last month at what he called the “exploitation” of new parents, joining the FSNT in calling for a cap on baby formula prices.
            <br><br>He welcomed Danone's move to reduce the price of Aptamil across the market, adding: “While we support breastfeeding as the most beneficial way of feeding infants, the millions of families who rely on formula need more support for their choice or circumstances and simply reducing the price won't solve the systemic issues we've drawn attention to.”
            <br><br>A Danone UK spokesperson said: “We recognise the challenges faced by parents due to inflation. During this difficult period, we have worked very hard to absorb the significant cost increases we have faced, make savings, and minimise any price increases.”
            <br><br>The company said it would continue to engage with the CMA over the coming months adding: “In Danone's experience the formula milks market is competitive.”

          <p>PRIVATE-SECTOR economists expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to keep monetary policy settings unchanged in January, after Singapore's headline and core inflation both eased in November.
            <br><br>Headline inflation for the month fell to 3.6 per cent on the year, from the 4.7 per cent recorded in October, on account of a fall in private transport prices, data from MAS and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed on Tuesday (Dec 26). November's print was also lower than the 3.9 per cent median forecast by private-sector economists polled by Bloomberg.
            <br><br>Core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, also inched down to 3.2 per cent, a tick lower than the 3.3 per year.
