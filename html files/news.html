          <h1>US inflation outstrips forecasts with rise to 3.4% for December</h1>

          <p>US inflation outstripped forecasts in December, hitting 3.4 per cent on an annual basis and dimming market expectations that 
            interest rates would fall as soon as March.
            <br><br>Economists had expected a rise of 3.2 per cent, up from 3.1 per cent in November.
            <br><br>The core rate also came in higher than economists had hoped, in an apparent vindication of the US Federal Reserve's caution over cutting rates from their 23-year-high.
            <br><br>US stocks fell following the data showing a headline 3.4 per cent annual rise in consumer prices. The blue-chip S&P 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite both declined 0.4 per cent in New York.
            <br><br>In the futures market, traders slightly reduced expectations that the Fed would cut rates in March. 
            <br><br>Rate setters have said that they want to be confident that inflation was moving towards their 2 per cent goal before dialling back on high interest rates.
            <br><br>The CPI number is not rate-setters' preferred measure of inflation, with most on the Fed's monetary policy committee focusing on the personal consumption expenditures index.
            <br><br>The PCE figure for December comes out on January 26, just five days before the Fed's next policy vote, and could show a lower inflation reading as it places far less weight on changes in the cost of shelter. Those costs rose 0.5 per cent month-on-month, according to Thursday's CPI report.
            <br><br>Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, was 3.9 per cent for the year to December, slightly lower than the 4 per cent figure for November, according to the data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But economists had expected 3.8 per cent.
            <br><br>Despite the uptick in December, price pressures fell much more sharply than expected in 2023, prompting the White House to note that inflation was now down about two-thirds from the peak seen during the summer of 2022.

          <p>Venezuela's 2023 inflation hit nearly 190%, but December prices barely ticked up
            <br><br>Venezuela's annual inflation rate settled at 189.8% last year, according to data from the central bank released on Friday, marking a slight easing of the still sky-high rate of rising consumer prices in the South American nation's battered economy.
            <br><br>The inflation rate during the previous year clocked in at 234%, one of the highest inflation rates anywhere in the world.
            <br><br>But Venezuela's monthly inflation for December eased to just 2.4%, according to the bank.
            <br><br>While Venezuela's economy has suffered a prolonged meltdown marked by triple-digit inflation and a mass exodus of millions of migrants seeking better prospects elsewhere, its inflation rate is no longer Latin America's steepest since Argentina's sped past 200% last year.

          <h1>Deflation: Here's where prices fell in December 2023, in one chart</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/3rd news article.webp" alt = "3rd news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Greg Iacurci<br>January 12 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>Deflation: Here's where prices fell in December 2023, in one chart
            <br><br>As inflation continues to throttle back across the broad U.S. economy, some consumer categories have sunk into outright deflation.
            In other words: Americans are seeing prices decline for certain items.
            Those pullbacks have largely been among physical goods rather than services, economists said.
            <br><br>Demand for goods soared early in the Covid-19 pandemic, as consumers were confined to their homes. The health crisis also snarled global supply chains for those goods. These dynamics drove up prices. Now, they're falling back to earth.
            <br><br>“You have seen some [price] give-back in some categories that were most affected by the shift in consumer demand, as well as being affected most severely by some of the supply-chain issues we saw over the course of the pandemic,” according to Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics.
            <br><br>For example, average prices have declined in these categories, among others, since December 2022: toys (by 4.5%), college textbooks (4.9%), televisions (10.3%), men's suits, sport coats, and outerwear (6%), sporting goods (2.5%), furniture and bedding (4.3%), and computer software and accessories (9.9%), according to the consumer price index.
            <br><br>“We bought a lot of goods because we couldn't go out, travel, go to ballgames” early in the pandemic, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. “There has been a shift from goods to things we couldn't do when we were shut in.”
            <br><br>Prices for used cars and trucks have also fallen, by 1.3%, according to CPI data.
            Used and new vehicle prices were among the first to surge when the U.S. economy reopened broadly early in 2021, amid a shortage of semiconductor chips essential for manufacturing.
            However, price levels on used cars remain more than 30% higher than they were pre-pandemic, meaning there's likely still ample room for a reversal, said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
            <br><br>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't assess health insurance inflation based on consumer premiums. It does so indirectly by measuring insurers' profits. This is because insurance quality varies greatly from person to person. One person's premiums may buy high-value insurance benefits, while another's buys meager coverage.
            <br><br>Those differences in quality make it difficult to gauge changes in health insurance prices with accuracy.
            <br><br>The 27.1% decline in health insurance prices last year reflects smaller insurer profits in 2021 relative to 2020.
            These sorts of quality adjustments mean consumers don't necessarily see prices drop at the store — only on paper.

          <h1>BOJ seen sticking to forecast of inflation staying near target, sources say</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/4th news article.avif" alt = "4th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Reuters<br>January 12 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>TOKYO : The Bank of Japan is expected this month to broadly maintain its projection that trend inflation will stay near its 2 per cent target in coming years, despite global economic uncertainties and soft consumption, say sources familiar with its thinking.
            <br><br>The projection will be part of the bank's quarterly outlook report due at its next rate review on Jan. 22-23, when the board is widely expected to keep ultra-loose policy settings unchanged.
            <br><br>Any such forecast will likely underscore the BOJ's cautious optimism that the economy was making steady progress towards sustainably achieving its 2 per cent inflation target - a prerequisite for pulling short-term interest rates out of negative territory.
            <br><br>The BOJ has maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1 per cent and the 10-year bond yield target around 0 per cent since 2016.
            <br><br>"Consumption is holding up and there's growing conviction that wage hikes will continue, and even broaden, this year," one source said.
            <br><br>"The broad uptrend in inflation and wages remains intact," said another source, a view echoed by three other people.
            <br><br>In the quarterly outlook report, the nine-member board releases a median projection on economic growth, core consumer inflation that strips away the effect of volatile fresh food prices, and "core core" inflation, which also excludes fuel costs.
            <br><br>The board is likely to cut its core inflation forecast for fiscal 2024, which begins in April, from the current projection of 2.8 per cent, due to recent falls in crude oil prices, the sources say.
            <br><br>But it is likely to make no major changes to its forecast that "core core" inflation, which the BOJ sees as a better gauge of the broader price trend, will hit 1.9 per cent in both fiscal 2024 and 2025, the sources say.
            <br><br>With inflation having exceeded the BOJ's 2 per cent target for well over a year, many market players expect the central bank to exit negative interest rates sometime this year in what would be a landmark move away from decades of ultra-loose monetary policy.
            <br><br>The BOJ's January quarterly report and Ueda's post-meeting briefing may offer clues on whether the central bank could phase out stimulus either at its March or April meetings.
            <br><br>Among key events that may sway the timing is the conclusion of annual wage negotiations between big firms and their unions in mid-March. The outcome becomes a benchmark for wage talks among smaller firms and sets the trend for nationwide pay.

          <h1>India's retail inflation rises to four-month high in December on higher food prices</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/5th news article.avif" alt = "5th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Reuters<br>January 12 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>INDIA'S annual retail inflation rose at the fastest pace in four months in December, driven by a rise in prices of some food items, raising expectations that the central bank will stay away from interest rate cuts for some time.
            <br><br>Annual retail inflation rose to 5.69 per cent in December from 5.55 per cent the previous month, above the central bank's 4 per cent target, Indian government data showed on Friday (Jan 12).
            <br><br>Food inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, was at 9.53 per cent in December, up from 8.70 per cent in November as prices of vegetables, pulses and spices rose.
            <br><br>“The outlook for the inflation for certain items like rice, wheat and pulses remains somewhat vulnerable,” said Aditi Nayar, an economist at ICRA, who does not expect rate cuts before August 2024.
            <br><br>The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent for a fifth consecutive meeting last month. With inflation remaining above the central bank's target, monetary policy could remain in “restrictive territory”, the RBI said in a report last month.
            <br><br>Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was estimated to be 3.8 per cent to 3.89 per cent in December, compared with 4.05 per cent to 4.2 per cent in November, according to two economists.
            <br><br>Core inflation has declined to a four-year low, said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research.
            <br><br>Declining core inflation, which can often reflect weak demand in the economy, is a “conundrum” at a time of strong economic growth, said Pant.
            <br><br>The Indian economy is seen growing at 7.3 per cent in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, according to the government's estimates.
            <br><br>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who remains popular among voters and is aiming to win a third term in a general election due by May, has taken several steps to contain food prices.

          <h1>From housing to energy to food, US inflation picks up, though some costs rise only mildly</h1>
          <img src = "../assets/6th news article.png" alt = "6th news article" loading = "lazy" class = "news-article">
          <h10>Written by: Paul Wiseman, Anne D'Innocenzio & Laura Bargfeld<br>January 12 2024</h10><br><br><br>
          <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Higher energy and housing prices boosted overall U.S. inflation in December, a sign that the Federal Reserve's drive to slow inflation to its 2% target will likely remain a bumpy one.
            <br><br>Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that overall prices rose 0.3% from November and 3.4% from 12 months earlier. Those gains exceeded the previous 0.1% monthly rise and the 3.1% annual inflation in November and were slightly above economists' forecasts.
            <br><br>More than half the increase in prices from November to December reflected higher housing costs. Energy costs, along with food prices, also contributed to inflation.
            <br><br>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, though, so-called core prices rose just 0.3% month over month, unchanged from November's increase. Core prices were up 3.9% from a year earlier — the mildest such pace since May 2021. Economists pay particular attention to core prices because, by excluding costs that typically jump around from month to month, they're seen as a better guide to the likely path of inflation.
            <br><br>Inflation has cooled more or less steadily since hitting 9.1% in mid-2022. Still, despite the slowdown in price increases, along with steady economic growth, low unemployment and healthy hiring, polls show many Americans are dissatisfied with the economy
            <br><br>That disconnect, a likely issue in the 2024 elections, has puzzled economists and political analysts. A major factor is the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Much of the public remains exasperated by higher prices. Prices are still 17% higher than they were before the inflation surge began and are still rising.
            <br><br>Pollsters and economists say there's never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception. Wage gains have outpaced inflation in recent months, meaning that Americans' average after-inflation take-home pay is up. Yet a poll conducted in November by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about three-quarters of respondents described the economy as poor. Two-thirds said their expenses had risen.
            <br><br>“Our grocery bill has doubled,” said Megan Cherry, a psychologist who lives with her husband and children in Temple Terrace, Florida. “We've got to change how much we get of each thing. Our kids noticed recently that, 'Wow, we eat a lot of chicken.' Well, because we can afford chicken.”
            <br><br>Thursday's figures reflected the outsize role that housing plays in the U.S. consumer price index — roughly a third of the index. A measure of homeownership alone makes up about 25% of CPI. The government measures homeownership costs by calculating how much rent a homeowner would likely charge if that home were being rented, a figure seen as equivalent to the cost of owning the property. Overall housing prices rose 0.5% from November to December. Rents were up 0.4%, homeownership 0.5%.
            <br><br>Over the past year, consumers have enjoyed price declines for some individual items. Furniture and bedding prices are down 4%, for example. Men's suits and coats are 6% lower, televisions 10%, sporting goods nearly 3%, sausages nearly 4%.
            <br><br>The Fed, which began aggressively raising interest rates in March 2022 to try to slow the pace of price increases, wants to reduce year-over-year inflation to its 2% target level. And there are solid reasons for optimism that inflationary pressure will continue to recede in the coming months.
